abstract = "Humans influence each other's emotions. The spread of emotion is well documented across behavioral, psychophysiological, and neuroscientific levels of analysis, but might this influence also be evident in language (e.g., are people more likely to use emotion words after hearing someone else use them)? The current study tests whether mothers and children influence each other's use of affective language. From 2018 to 2020, children aged 6–12 who met diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders and their mothers (N = 93 dyads) completed a challenging puzzle task while being video recorded. Analyses of transcriptions revealed that mothers and children indeed influenced each other's language. Bidirectional influence was observed for use of negative affect words: Mothers were more likely to use negative affect words if their child had just used negative affect words (over and above mothers' own language on their previous turn), and children were similarly influenced by mother affect word use. A similar bidirectional relation emerged for linguistic distance, a measure related to effective emotion regulation and mental health. However, the significance of the child-to-mother direction of influence for these two variables varied depending on correction threshold and should thus be verified in future research. Nonetheless, these findings extend understanding of emotional influence by showing turn-by-turn relations between the use of affective language."

abstract = "In the wake of the global pandemic, interacting with others while wearing masks has emerged as a global challenge. A growing body of literature has reported that face masks hinder emotion recognition in Western populations. Given that diagnostic facial features for recognizing specific emotions (e.g., happiness) differ between Western and Eastern cultures, there may be cultural differences in the effects of face masks on emotion recognition. Relying on the previous findings showing cultural differences in emotion recognition, we conducted a preregistered study where 203 American and 209 Japanese participants judged the emotional expressions of faces (happy, fearful, angry, sad, disgust, and neutral) with and without masks. The results showed cultural differences in emotion recognition of faces with and without masks. Specifically, face masks decreased the accuracy of happy emotion recognition in the Americans but not in the Japanese. The results suggest that the effect of wearing masks on emotion recognition depends on the types of emotions and culture and supports previous findings indicating cultural differences in the decoding strategy for facial expressions."

abstract = "Emotions that are shared by a large number of people could broadly impact affective experiences at the individual level. Here, we used text mining on popular song lyrics—a cultural product that has been suggested to mirror emotions that many members of a society value and prefer—to track the changes in emotions over time. Morpheme frequency analysis and structural topic modeling on 2,962 hit K-pop songs from 1990 to 2019 showed converging evidence for increased positive emotional content and decreased negative emotional content embedded within the lyrics. This pattern of temporal shift in emotions aligned with rapid changes in South Korea in the past 30 years, notably a rise in individualism and ego orientation in a traditionally collectivistic culture, as well as economic growth. More generally, this study illustrates a strategy for tracking emotions that people value and prefer from large natural language data, supplementing existing methods such as self-reported surveys and laboratory experiments."

abstract = "Emotional displays of politicians can be persuasive. According to prominent psychological theories, we can easily “catch” the emotional displays of others through mimicry and emotional contagion. Do these processes work for politicians too, or is it conditional on what voters think of the politician making the display? In a preregistered within-subjects laboratory experiment, participants observed images of neutral and manipulated emotional displays of politicians. We measured emotional mimicry (facial electromyography) and emotional contagion (self-reports). We do not find evidence for the matched motor hypothesis. Our findings are in line with the emotional mimicry in social context model. Namely, we find that the happy displays of in-party politicians elicit congruent facial activity (a positive facial index). Furthermore, the displays of the out-party politicians do not elicit mimicry, but instead our findings suggest a reactive response: Participants smiled in response to angry out-party politicians. The self-reported emotions indicated a small effect of emotional contagion. Taken together, our study provides insights in how voters are emotionally affected by politicians’ emotional displays and highlights that our polarized prior beliefs color our emotional responses to politics.

abstract = "Prosocial behavior, any behavior with the goal of benefiting another person, has been shown to improve mood and boost overall well-being for the individual performing the action as well as the recipient. The purpose of this study was to assess whether prosocial behavior could also reduce state loneliness. To examine this, we conducted two experimental studies to evaluate the effect of different prosocial behaviors on loneliness and associated cognitive and affective measures. In Study 1, we operationalized prosocial behavior as gift giving, and participants (n = 286) were randomly assigned to complete either a gift giving, gift keeping, or neutral control task. In Study 2, prosocial behavior was operationalized as writing a note of appreciation to a close other, and participants (n = 288) were randomly assigned to complete a written note of appreciation to a close other, a written reflection of a time when they received social support in the past, or a neutral control task. Across both studies, prosocial behavior reliably reduced state loneliness and improved mood but was less effective at reducing negative automatic thoughts about the self. Depressive and social anxiety symptoms were explored as possible moderators of the effects of prosocial behavior on outcome measures and were found to be significant moderators in Study 2, but not Study 1. Future directions and implications of these findings are discussed."

abstract = "People frequently report feeling more than one emotion at the same time (i.e., blended emotions), but studies on nonverbal communication of such complex states remain scarce. Actors (N = 18) expressed blended emotions consisting of all pairwise combinations of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness – using facial gestures, body movement, and vocal sounds – with the intention that both emotions should be equally prominent in the resulting expression. Accuracy of blended emotion recognition was assessed in two preregistered studies using a combined forced-choice and rating scale task. For each recording, participants were instructed to choose two scales (out of 5 available scales: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness) that best described their perception of the emotional content and judge how clearly each of the two chosen emotions were perceived. Study 1 (N = 38) showed that all emotion combinations were accurately recognized from multimodal (facial/bodily/vocal) expressions, with significantly higher ratings on scales corresponding to intended vs. non-intended emotions. Study 2 (N = 51) showed that all emotion combinations were also accurately perceived when the recordings were presented in unimodal visual (facial/bodily) and auditory (vocal) conditions, although accuracy was lower in the auditory condition. To summarize, results suggest that blended emotions, including combinations of both same-valence and other-valence emotions, can be accurately recognized from dynamic facial/bodily and vocal expressions. The validated recordings of blended emotion expressions are freely available for research purposes."
